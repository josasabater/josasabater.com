    <div class="aboutMe">Josa is an artist and educator based and raised in Providence, Rhode Island. At the Rhode Island School of Design, Josa is studying to complete a BFA in Film/Animation/Video and Sculpture. Their work explores notions of vulnerability as they examine personal experiences, re-contextualize memories, and share them as a means of processing. Josa expresses experiences at the intersection of their racial, queer, and domestic trauma without full disclosure so that others may see themselves and process their own experiences through their work.
      
      At non-profit organizations <a href="https://www.pvdstudentunion.org">Providence Student Union</a> and <a href="https://newurbanarts.org">New Urban Arts</a>, Josa works as a Teaching Artist and Artist Mentor, respectively.</div>
